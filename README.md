# iPhone Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes iPhone sales data from Flipkart to uncover trends in customer ratings, reviews, and pricing. Using Python and interactive visualizations, the project explores the relationships between key variables like sales price, discount percentage, and customer ratings.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values and ensured the dataset was clean.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified trends in customer ratings, pricing, and reviews.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Used Plotly to create dynamic charts that display the relationships between sales price, discounts, and ratings.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated the relationship between sales price and customer engagement (ratings and reviews).
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Forecasted future sales trends using regression models.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Statsmodels**: For adding regression trendlines.

## Key Findings
1. There is a negative correlation between iPhone sales price and the number of ratings, indicating that higher-priced iPhones tend to have fewer ratings.
2. Discounts on iPhones drive higher engagement, as evident by the relationship between discount percentages and the number of ratings.
3. The analysis provides actionable insights into pricing strategy and customer purchasing behavior on e-commerce platforms.
